## About Us
SG DO WHAT? aims to provide tourists visiting Singapore an enjoyable and fuss-free experience. As Singapore's weather can be rather unpredictable, our website offers a wide range of activities for tourists to take part in in the event of bad weather. Our website also allows for tourists to filter places based on their preferences such as outdoor/indoor activities, nature trails, food, or heritage sites.

Additionally, SG DO WHAT? aims to introduce tourists to less well-known places that are often not suggested on other visitor sites so that they can explore these places as well.
