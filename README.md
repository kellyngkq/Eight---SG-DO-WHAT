**About us** <br>
SG DO WHAT? aims to provide tourists visiting Singapore an enjoyable and fuss-free experience. As Singapore's weather can be rather unpredictable, our website offers a wide range of activities for tourists to partake in Singapore regardless of the weather. In the event of bad weather, tourists can view indoor places that will allow them to seek shelter while exploring Singapore. 

## Accounts for testing 
Our website supports 2 different roles: tutors and tutees. Hence, we created 2 different test accounts for you to test the different functionalities (except account creation) for each role. <br>
